# Steam-engine
• The project simulates the working of a steam engine.
• It illustrates how the linear motion of the piston is converted into rotary motion. The engine is initially at rest. On right clicking, the user is provided with a menu which provides five options-shaded, animate, and increase speed, decrease speed, transparent.
• The animate option starts the steam engine from rest or stops the engine if it is running.
• The speed of the engine can then be increased by the increase speed option or decreased by the decrease speed option.
• The texture of the engine can be changed by the shaded option. There are two textures. One being the normal solid fill and the other being wireframe. The transparent option makes the front portion of the cylinder transparent and shows the up and down motion of the piston.
